# blipsblops
Ardunio controller for RGB LED strips to simulate old timey sci fi computers. Use in movie props or just about anywhere.

Works with APA102 and WS2812 RGB LED strips.

## LED strip setup
Each active LED is defined in an array of structs.

```C++
typedef struct ledPersonality {
  int ledNum;             // Target LED index, 0 to NUM_LEDS
  int trigger;            // Toggle on/off every "trigger"th step (1 step = 1 loop):
                             // 1 = every step;
                             // 2 = every second step and so on
  int offset;             // Hit "trigger" after "offset" steps
  CRGB color;             // Color like CRGB::Red etc
  int lastStepTriggered;  // Last time on was triggered. Always start at 0. Do not change this.
  float symmetricRatio;   // Skew ratio between on and off:
                             // 0.5 = on is twice as long as off;
                             // 1.0 = symmetric on/off ratio;
                             // 3.0 = off is thrice as long as on
  float accuracy;         // Accuracy of trigger time, 1 to 100:
                             // 100 = trigger exactly when supposed to;
                             // 50  = 50% chance of triggering when supposed to;
                             // 1   = very random;
  int fadeOut;            // Fading out of led, 0.0 to 99.9:
                             // 0.0 =  do not fade out;
                             // 50.0 = fade out
                             // 99.0 = fade out very slowly
};
```

### Pick random color
For a random color, assign `CRGB::Black` to `color`.
```C++
{0, 75, 0, CRGB::Black, 0, 1.0, 100.0, 0},
```
Each step where the trigger of this LED is firing, a random color will be chosen from your `colorSpace[]` array.

This array can contain multiple identical values, which makes them more likely to be chosen.

```C++
CRGB colorSpace[] = {CRGB::Red, CRGB::Red, CRGB::Green, CRGB::White, ... };
```

# Workflow
You can assign any LED on your strip a rhythm, a color, and various other settings.
You do not have to declare every single LED, its possible to just define any LED you need to blip and to blop.

The rhythm of "on" and "off" is defined for each LED in an array of structs.
Each LED has a `trigger` defined, e.g. `3`. This LED triggers every *n*th step which is a multiple of `3`.
`3` means that this LED triggers every *third* step to be either *on* or *off*. Every step is as fast as your `speed` variable.

The `speed` in milliseconds should be defined to match the fastest blinking LED.

### Text based examples

So if you want a simple single flashing LED that toggles on and off every second:
- Set `speed` to `1000` milliseconds
- Set the `trigger` of a LED to `1` step

If you want to have two LEDs to alternate every half second:
- Set `speed` to `500` milliseconds
- Set the `trigger` of LED 1 to `1` step
- Set the `trigger` of LED 2 to `1` step and `offset` to 1 step

If you want to fade out a LED every second:
- Set `speed` to `15` milliseconds
- Set the `trigger` of a LED to `67` steps (1000ms/15ms=66.6)
- Set `fadeOut` of a LED to `25`%

As the fade out logic needs the `speed` variable to fade out the LEDs, set it to `15`, which is the sweet spot for PWM dimming. Calculate how many steps it takes for the trigger to reach *1000* (it takes ~67 steps @ 15ms each to reach 1 second).

Note: A "*fade in*" mode is not implemented.

# Beware: Flickering on camera when using fadeOut options

If you set the `brightness` to anything other than *255* ("max") or set `fadeout` to anything other than *0* ("do not fade out"), be prepared to see flickering on camera, because this uses PMW for dimming/fading out.
